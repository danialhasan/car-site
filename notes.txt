ADMIN AUTH STEPS
When user tries to access https://domain.com/backend, show login page if user isn't
signed in. If they sign in, store information in session storage. 

Idea: make the default state of the backend nodejs server, the login page. The dashboard 
will be replaced by the actual backend html page. When someone tries to access server.js, 
the website should return a CANNOT GET /SERVER error.


idea: Take the backend.html and backend.js file from this project and place it in the login 
project. Then, when the admin route is taken, the login project takes over.
